# Building And Deploying %AtCore
Building %AtCore is broken up into to main steps Configuration and Building. Deploying %AtCore is also covered here.

## Configuration 
In order to configure your build you will need [cmake] and [extra-cmake-modules]. 

%AtCore Build Options Are: 
 - -DBUILD_GUI = ( ON | OFF )  Build the test client (Default is OFF)
 - -DBUILD_DOCS = (ON | OFF ) Build the Documentation (Default is OFF)
 - -DBUILD_TESTS = ( ON | OFF ) Build and Run Unittests (Default is OFF)
 - -DDEPLOY_PLUGINS_WITH_BINARY ( ON | OFF ) Deploy the plugins to bin/plugins (Default is OFF, Turn on for win/mac)
 
Recommended CMake Command

Linux
```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_INSTALL+LIBDIR=lib CMakeLists.txt
```

Mac OS/ Windows
```
cmake -DDEPLOY_PLUGINS_WITH_BINARY=ON CMakeLists.txt
```
## Building
After Configuring you Should be able to run make to build all targets.

```
make
```

## Dependencies
In addition to a working development enviroment for your system you will need the following to build %AtCore
 - qt5-base
 - qt5-serialport
 - qt5-widgets
 - qt5-charts
 
Building The Documentation adds the following dependency:
 - [doxygen]

### Installing Dependencies on Windows and Mac OS

#### Mac Os
Mac Os users could use [homebrew] to install both cmake and cmake-extra-modules using.
```
brew update
brew install cmake
brew tap KDE-mac/kde;
brew install kf5-extra-cmake-modules
```
Then can download and install [Qt]

#### Windows
Windows users could install [chocolatey] and do something like 
```
choco install cmake
choco install ninja
git clone -q git://anongit.kde.org/extra-cmake-modules.git
cd extra-cmake-modules
cmake -G "Ninja" . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= <CMAKE_INSTALL_ROOT>
ninja install
```
Then Download and install [Qt]

## Deploying %AtCore
After you build you may wish to deploy atcore on your system for use
### Linux
From the build dir the command below to install atcore with its plugins to the system (assuming cmake used above)
```
sudo make install
```
### Finding Plugins
AtCore will check each directory below for plugins.

    1. QApplication::applicationDirPath/plugins
    2. QApplication::applicationDirPath/AtCore
    3. QApplication::applicationDirPath/../PlugIns/AtCore
    4. INSTALL_PREFIX/KDE_PLUGIN_DIR/AtCore
    5. QT_Plugin_Path/AtCore
    6. KDE_PLUGIN_DIR/AtCore
    7. BUILDDIR for plugins.

For Locations starting with 'QApplication::applicationDirPath'  atcore will look next to the binary using atcore.
Usually this is in a directory next to the program 
```
atcore_test_GUI\atcore-gui.exe
atcore_test_GUI\AtCore.dll
atcore_test_GUI\plugins\repetier.dll
```

But on Mac OS this is in the app bundle 
```
atcore-gui.app/Contents/MacOS/atcore-gui
atcore-gui.app/Contents/MacOS/AtCore.dylib
atcore-gui.app/Contents/MacOS/plugins/repetier.dylib
```
